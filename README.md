*SEANEMA Software engineer academy at University of Indonesia*

Software engineering academy Hosted by University of Indonesia. The academy aims to develop skilled software engineers by providing practical, industry-focused training. As part of a project, we are tasked with creating a cinema booking website that offers users the convenience of selecting user preferred seats and completing their payments online.

This cinema booking website will serve as a platform where movie enthusiasts can easily browse through available movies, check showtimes, and select their desired seats. By incorporating an intuitive user interface, users will be able to navigate through the website seamlessly and effortlessly.

To implement the seat selection functionality, i design a visually appealing and interactive seating arrangement layout. Users will have the ability to view the available seats in real-time and choose their desired seating positions. The system will dynamically update the seat availability status to avoid conflicts and overbooking.

Additionally, the website also provide user to do payment seamlessly.
